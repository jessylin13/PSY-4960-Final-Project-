Description: "The aim of this research is to examine the relations between self-cognitions and depression in adolescents, as well as the influence of parenting behavior on these processes. Two-hundred and forty-three Grade 7 students were followed over a two-year period, with self-report data collected at three time-points. They reported on their self-esteem, self-criticism, and depression, as well as parenting behaviors. Parents also provided self-report data at time one. Noting here that all identifying material has been removed."

Research Questions: 
1. Is self-criticism better correlated with depressive symptoms than self-esteem in adolescents in grade 7?
2. Is the relationship between self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression similar when comparing boys and girls?
3. Is there a significant difference between the adolescents' depressive symptoms  at time 1 and time 3?

Hypothesis:
1. Self-esteem will have a higher correlation with depression than self-criticism in adolescents in grade 7. 
2. The relationship between boys and girls when it comes to self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression are not similar; girls will yield higher rates of depression, lower self-esteem, and higher self-criticism. 
3. Mean depressive symptoms will be higher at time 3 than they were for time 1.

1. Correlation between self-criticism with depressive symptoms and self-esteem with depressive symptoms in adolescents in grade 7. 
- CritT= Self-critism (Total)
- RosT= Self-esteem (Total)
- CDIt= Depressive symptoms (Total)

```{r}
library(haven)
SEDA<- read_sav("~/Desktop/SEDA data_deidentified.sav")
summary(is.na(SEDA$CritT))
cor(SEDA$CritT,SEDA$CDIt,use = "complete.obs")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(SEDA, aes(CritT,CDIt)) +geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
#This is the correlation between self-criticism and depressive symptoms in adolescents in grade 7.
```

```{r}
cor(SEDA$RosT,SEDA$CDIt,use = "complete.obs")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(SEDA, aes(RosT,CDIt)) +geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
#This is the correlation between self-esteem and depressive symptoms in adolescents in grade 7.
```

2. Repeated Measures ANOVA test comparing boys and girls to their levels of self-criticism (CritT), self-esteem(RosT), and depression(CDIt). In the SEDA dataset gender was dummy coded with 1=Girl and 0=Boy. Below I have included the initial set-up for the columns of interest, those being gender (SexALL;Gender), self-criticism (CritT), self-esteem (RosT), and depressive symptoms (CDIt).
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(car)

#Columns Set-up 
SEDA$SexALL #1=girls, 0=boys
SEDA$CritT #self-criticism
SEDA$RosT #self-esteem
SEDA$CDIt #depression

#Columns set-up into a smaller dataset for cleaner usage of the data.  
SEDA2<-SEDA[,c(5,88,101,205),use = "complete.obs"]

#Separating Columns via Gender for readability.
library(tidyverse)
SEDA2$Gender<-ifelse(SEDA2$SexALL==1, "Girls","Boys")
```
#Anova of self-criticism comparing boys and girls.
```{r}
aov(SEDA2$CritT~SEDA2$Gender)
SEDA2 %>% filter(is.na(Gender) == FALSE) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x=Gender,y=CritT,color=Gender))+geom_boxplot()+stat_boxplot(geom='errorbar')+ylab("Levels of self-criticism")+scale_color_manual(values=c('#2c7fb8','#a37fdb'))
#This is an Anova taken to compare boys and girls levels of self-criticism, represented visually through a box plot.
```
#Anova of self-esteem comparing boys and girls.
```{r}
aov(SEDA2$RosT~SEDA2$Gender)
SEDA2 %>% filter(is.na(Gender) == FALSE) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(y=RosT, x=Gender,color=Gender)) +
   geom_boxplot()+stat_boxplot(geom='errorbar')+ylab("Levels of self-esteem")+scale_color_manual(values=c('#2c7fb8','#a37fdb'))
#This is an Anova taken to compare boys and girls levels of self-esteem, represented visually through a box plot.
```
#Anova of depression comparing boys and girls.
```{r}
aov(SEDA2$CDIt~SEDA2$Gender)
SEDA2 %>% filter(is.na(Gender) == FALSE) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(y=CDIt, x=Gender,color=Gender)) +
   geom_boxplot()+stat_boxplot(geom='errorbar')+ylab("Levels of depression")+scale_color_manual(values=c('#2c7fb8','#a37fdb'))
#This is an Anova taken to compare boys and girls levels of depression, represented visually through a box plot.
```

3. Repeated measures ANOVA of the adolescents in grade 7 from time 1 to time 3 of their mean depressive symptoms.
- T1= Time Point 1
- T3= Time Point 3
When comparing the two repeated measures ANOVA test, the adolescents in grade 7 from time 1 to time 3 and their mean depressive symptoms were not significantly different from one another. Their p-values were 0.849 for Time 1 and 0.78 for Time 3.

```{r}
Time1<-aov(CDIt~T1+ SexALL, data=SEDA)
summary(Time1)
plot(Time1)
#This repeated measures ANOVA test, tests the adolescents in grade 7 and their mean depressive symptoms at Time 1.
```

```{r}
Time3<- aov(CDIt~T3+ SexALL, data=SEDA)
summary(Time3)
plot(Time3)
#This repeated measures ANOVA test, tests the adolescents in grade 7 and their mean depressive symptoms at Time 3.
```
