Description: "The aim of this research is to examine the relations between self-cognitions and depression in adolescents, as well as the influence of parenting behaviour on these processes. Two-hundred and forty-three Grade 7 students were followed over a two-year period, with self-report data collected at three time-points. They reported on their self-esteem, self-criticism, and depression, as well as parenting behaviours. Parents also provided self-report data at time one. Noting here that all identifying material has been removed."

Research Questions: 
1. Is self-criticism better correlated with depressive symptoms than self-esteem in adolescents in grade 7?
2. Is the relationship between self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression similar when comparing boys and girls?
3. Is there a significant difference between the adolescents' depressive symptoms  at time 1 and time 3?

Hypothesis:
1. Self-esteem will have a higher correlation with depression than self-criticism in adolescents in grade 7. 
2. The relationship between boys and girls when it comes to self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression are not similar; girls will yield higher rates of depression, lower self-esteem, and higher self-criticism. 
3. Mean depressive symptoms will be higher at time 3 than they were for time 1.

1. Correlation between self-criticism with depressive symptoms and self-esteem with depressive symptoms in adolescents in grade 7. 
- CritT= Self-critism (Total)
- RosT= Self-esteem (Total)
- CDIt= Depressive symptoms (Total)
```{r}
library(haven)
SEDA<- read_sav("~/Desktop/SEDA data_deidentified.sav")
summary(is.na(SEDA$CritT))
cor(SEDA$CritT,SEDA$CDIt,use = "complete.obs")
ggplot(SEDA, aes(CritT,CDIt)) +geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
#This is the correlation between self-criticism and depressive symptoms in adolescents in grade 7.
```

```{r}
cor(SEDA$RosT,SEDA$CDIt,use = "complete.obs")
ggplot(SEDA, aes(RosT,CDIt)) +geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
#This is the correlation between self-esteem and depressive symptoms in adolescents in grade 7.
```

2. ANOVA test comparing boys and girls to their levels of self-criticism (CritT), self-esteem(RosT), and depression(CDIt).(boy=0; girl=1); make new columns for boys and girls, self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression. 
```{r}
#Columns Set-up 
SEDA$SexALL #1=girls, 0=boys
SEDA$CritT #self-criticism
SEDA$RosT #self-esteem
SEDA$CDIt #depression

#Columns 
SEDA2<-SEDA[,c(5,88,101,205)]

#Separating Columns via Gender 
library(tidyverse)

#I want to be able to separate the data, so that the girls (1) and the boys (0) values are separated into two separate columns. The goal is to compare how boys and girls performed and I want to separate the column values, but am finding it difficult to do so. 
SEDA2$Gender<-NA
SEDA2$Gender<-ifelse(SEDA2$SexALL==1, "Girl","Boy")
SEDA2$Gender<-as.numeric(SEDA2$Gender)
lm(SEDA2$SexALL~SEDA2$CritT)

```
#self-criticism
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(car)

CritL<-lm(SEDA2$SexALL~SEDA2$CritT)
Anova(CritL)
```
#self-esteem
```{r}
library(car)
RosL<-lm(SEDA2$SexALL~SEDA2$RosT)
Anova(RosL)
```
#depression
```{r}
library(car)
CDIL<-lm(SEDA2$SexALL~SEDA2$CDIt)
Anova(CDIL)
```

3. Repeated measures ANOVA of the adolescents in grade 7 from time 1 to time 3 of their mean depressive symptoms. aov(dv~iv+subj, date), Anova (Ds~Timepoint+Error(Subj)); don't interpret F statistics. 

```{r}
Time1<-aov(CDIt~T1+ SexALL, data=SEDA)
summary(Time1)
plot(Time1)
#This repeated measures ANOVA test, tests the adolescents in grade 7 and their mean depressive symptoms at Time 1.
```

```{r}
Time3<- aov(CDIt~T3+ SexALL, data=SEDA)
summary(Time3)
plot(Time3)
#This repeated measures ANOVA test, tests the adolescents in grade 7 and their mean depressive symptoms at Time 3.
