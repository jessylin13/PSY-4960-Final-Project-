# PSY-4960-Final-Project-

This project was created by Na'Jai Wilson and Jessy Lin using Gittins and Hunts (2020)'s Self-Esteem and Depression in Adolescents (SEDA) study dataset. Gittin and Hunts (2020) study examined the relationships between self-cognitions and mental health outcomes in 243 Australian adolescents. 

With this dataset we explored the following three research questions: 1) Is self-criticism better correlated with depressive symptoms than self-esteem in adolescents in grade 7? 2) Is the relationship between self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression similar when comparing boys and girls? 3) Is there a significant difference between the adolescents' depressive symptoms  at time 1 and time 3?

All information as it pertains to the dataset can be found here: https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/21441?show=full
