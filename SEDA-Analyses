Description: "The aim of this research is to examine the relations between self-cognitions and depression in adolescents, as well as the influence of parenting behavior on these processes. Two-hundred and forty-three Grade 7 students were followed over a two-year period, with self-report data collected at three time-points. They reported on their self-esteem, self-criticism, and depression, as well as parenting behaviors. Parents also provided self-report data at time one. Noting here that all identifying material has been removed."

Research Questions: 
1. Is self-criticism better correlated with depressive symptoms than self-esteem in adolescents in grade 7?
2. Is the relationship between self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression similar when comparing boys and girls?
3. Is there a significant difference between the adolescents' depressive symptoms  at time 1 and time 3?

Hypothesis:
1. Self-esteem will have a higher correlation with depression than self-criticism in adolescents in grade 7. 
2. The relationship between boys and girls when it comes to self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression are not similar; girls will yield higher rates of depression, lower self-esteem, and higher self-criticism. 
3. Mean depressive symptoms will be higher at time 3 than they were for time 1.

1. Correlation between self-criticism with depressive symptoms and self-esteem with depressive symptoms in adolescents in grade 7. 
- CritT= Self-critism (Total)
- RosT= Self-esteem (Total)
- CDIt= Depressive symptoms (Total)

2. One-Way ANOVA test comparing boys and girls on their levels of self-criticism (CritT), self-esteem(RosT), and depression(CDIt). In the SEDA dataset gender was dummy coded with 1=Girl and 0=Boy. Below I have included the initial set-up for the columns of interest, those being gender (SexALL;Gender), self-criticism (CritT), self-esteem (RosT), and depressive symptoms (CDIt). I have also included the analyses of the three one-way Anovas comparing boys and girls in their scores of self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression. 
```{r}
#Loading the appropriate packages to run the code below: 
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
library(jtools)
```
The following columns are of interest as it relates to our secondary analyses:  
Gender(SEDA$Gender)is coded as 1=girls, 0=boys.
Self-criticism(SEDA$CritT)
Self-esteem(SEDA$RosT)
Depression (SEDA$CDIt)
```{r}
#Columns Set-up: These columns are set-up for the purposes of cleaner secondary data analysis with the SEDA dataset. 
SEDA2<-SEDA[,c(5,88,101,205),use = "complete.obs"]

#Separating Columns via Gender for readability.
library(tidyverse)
SEDA2$Gender<-ifelse(SEDA$SexALL==1,"Girls", "Boys")

#Checking the class of gender to ensure the correct Anova output is reached. The class of gender is changed to factor. 
class(SEDA2$Gender)
SEDA2$Gender<-as.factor(SEDA2$Gender)
```

This is a one-way Anova of self-criticism comparing boys and girls; it is represented visually with the use of a box and whiskers plot. 
```{r}
#Analyses;One-Way Anova
summary(aov(CritT~Gender, data=SEDA2))

#Boxplot graph of One-Way Anova
SEDA2 %>% filter(is.na(Gender) == FALSE) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x=Gender,y=CritT,color=Gender))+geom_boxplot()+stat_boxplot(geom='errorbar')+ylab("Levels of self-criticism")+scale_color_manual(values=c('#2c7fb8','#a37fdb'))+ggtitle("Self-criticism in Boys and Girls")+theme_apa()
```

This is a one-way Anova of self-esteem comparing boys and girls; it is represented visually with the use of a box and whiskers plot. 
```{r}
#Analyses;One-Way Anova
aov(RosT~Gender, data=SEDA2)

#Boxplot graph of One-Way Anova
SEDA2 %>% filter(is.na(Gender) == FALSE) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(y=RosT, x=Gender,color=Gender)) +
   geom_boxplot()+stat_boxplot(geom='errorbar')+ylab("Levels of self-esteem")+scale_color_manual(values=c('#2c7fb8','#a37fdb'))+ggtitle("Self-esteem in Boys and Girls")+theme_apa()
```

This is a one-way Anova of depression comparing boys and girls; it is represented visually with the use of a box and whiskers plot. 
```{r}
#Analyses;One-Way Anova
aov(CDIt~Gender, data=SEDA2)

#Boxplot graph of One-Way Anova
SEDA2 %>% filter(is.na(Gender) == FALSE) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(y=CDIt, x=Gender,color=Gender))+
   geom_boxplot()+stat_boxplot(geom='errorbar')+ylab("Levels of depression")+scale_color_manual(values=c('#2c7fb8','#a37fdb'))+ggtitle("Depression in Boys and Girls")+theme_apa()
```

Descriptive Statistics were also taken to further compare the means of self-criticism, self-esteem, and depression in boys and girls. I began by subsetting the SEDA2 dataset creating two separate datasets of boys and girls and then using the summary function for descriptives in these two groups.
Descriptive Statistics for Girls 
```{r}
Girls<-SEDA2 %>% filter(SEDA$SexALL==1)
summary(girls$CritT)#mean=36.59
summary(girls$RosT)#mean=31.09
summary(girls$CDIt)#mean=4.256
```
Descriptive Statistics for Boys
```{r}
Boys<-SEDA2 %>% filter(SEDA2$SexALL==0)
summary(boys$CritT)#mean=33.71
summary(boys$RosT)#mean=30.28
summary(boys$CDIt)#mean=4.684
```

3. Repeated measures ANOVA of the adolescents in grade 7 from time 1 to time 3 of their mean depressive symptoms.
- T1= Time Point 1
- T3= Time Point 3
When comparing the two repeated measures ANOVA test, the adolescents in grade 7 from time 1 to time 3 and their mean depressive symptoms were not significantly different from one another. Their p-values were 0.849 for Time 1 and 0.78 for Time 3.

```{r}
Time1<-aov(CDIt~T1+ SexALL, data=SEDA)
summary(Time1)
plot(Time1)
#This repeated measures ANOVA test, tests the adolescents in grade 7 and their mean depressive symptoms at Time 1.
```

```{r}
Time3<- aov(CDIt~T3+ SexALL, data=SEDA)
summary(Time3)
plot(Time3)
#This repeated measures ANOVA test, tests the adolescents in grade 7 and their mean depressive symptoms at Time 3.
```
